# Boston-Crime-Analysis

This project was done as a data analytics tool on the dataset inside of this folder. There are two R notebooks and their HTML versions (which can be looked at for simplicity), where all of the code is writted and the outputs are displayed.

The dataset consists of Boston Crimes conducted over a 3-4 year period with various information about the crime like the location (longitude and latitude), date, type of crime etc. The dataset was found on Kaggle and various notebooks on Kaggle conducted Explorotory Data Anlysis on this dataset but we wanted to look at this data set as a time series dataset.

There are various steps conducted through the two notebooks, and there is information about each step and the conclusions drawn along the way writted within the notebooks.
